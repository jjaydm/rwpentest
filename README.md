# rwpentest


Had the pleasure of conducting my first real world penetration test with a company I have been close with for quite a few years. Any sensitive information will be [REDACTED] for privacy reasons. At the time of the upload of this repo, all identified vulnerabilities have been patched.
To preface, I mainly focused on enumeration and discovery of sensitive information. Throughout the course of this short penetration test, I was able to identify:
8 WP admin logins
Staff personal information: addresses, phone numbers, email logins, etc...
FTP Anonymous Login was enabled
Ability to bake cookies to access admin areas
SSH service is open and running, with default credentials
Hidden directories: robots.txt, security.txt, etc...
Publicly accessible domains: dev.[REDACTED].com, [REDACTED].com/wp-login.php
I plan to further document the mitigation of such vulnerabilities.
In conclusion, I am extremely happy to get some real word experience while helping out close friends and providing necessary insight to protect themselves. Although I was not able to expand on the vulnerabilities by performing the exploits first hand, I believe I provided an abundance of information necessary to help further secure the organization.
